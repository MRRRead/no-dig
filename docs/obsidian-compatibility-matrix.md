## Implementation Notes

### Wikilinks and Aliases

NO-DIG implements full support for Obsidian-style wikilinks, including:

- Case sensitivity matching Obsidian's behavior
- Proper handling of spaces and special characters
- Full support for alias syntax with the pipe character
- Automatic resolution of ambiguous links

Example:
```markdown
[[Page Name]] becomes <a href="/page-name">Page Name</a>
[[Page Name|Custom Text]] becomes <a href="/page-name">Custom Text</a>
```

### Embedded Content

Embedded content is fully supported with appropriate transformations:

- Note embeds are converted to included HTML content
- Image embeds are converted to optimized, responsive images
- Block embeds are converted to the specific referenced content

Example:
```markdown
![[Note Title]] becomes the full HTML content of that note
![[image.png]] becomes an optimized, responsive image
![[Note Title#Heading]] becomes the content under that heading
```

### Frontmatter

Frontmatter is used for both Obsidian compatibility and business website features:

```yaml
---
title: "Product Page"
description: "Our flagship product details"
schemaType: "Product"
product:
  name: "Premium Widget"
  price: 99.99
  currency: "USD"
  availability: "InStock"
image: "product-hero.jpg"
noIndex: false
canonical: "https://example.com/products/premium-widget"
---
```

### Limitations

1. **Canvas Files**: Obsidian Canvas files are not currently supported
2. **Complex Dataview**: Advanced Dataview queries may require custom plugins
3. **System Commands**: Templater system commands are not supported for security reasons

2. **Advanced Dataview**: Better support for complex Dataview queries
3. **Visual Graph**: Optional interactive graph visualization
