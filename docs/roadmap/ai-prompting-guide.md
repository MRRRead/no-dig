# AI Prompting Guide for NO-DIG Development

This guide provides specific instructions for leveraging AI tools (Manus, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) effectively during the development of NO-DIG. Following these guidelines will ensure consistent, high-quality AI assistance throughout the project lifecycle.

## Available AI Tools

As a developer working on NO-DIG, you have access to:

1. **Manus** - For complex, multi-step reasoning tasks
2. **ChatGPT** - For content generation and ideation
3. **GitHub Copilot** - For in-editor code assistance in VSCode

## General AI Prompting Strategy

For all AI interactions, follow these principles:

1. **Provide Context**: Always include information about:
   - The NO-DIG project and its business website focus
   - The current development phase
   - The specific task you're working on
   - Any relevant constraints or requirements

2. **Use the Expert System Prompt**: Begin interactions with the Web Development Expert System Prompt (see [[roadmap/expert-system-prompt]]) to establish the appropriate expertise level.

3. **Be Specific**: Request concrete implementations rather than general advice.

4. **Iterate**: Use follow-up questions to refine and improve initial responses.

5. **Verify**: Always review and test AI-generated code before implementation.

## Tool-Specific Guidance

```

### Using GitHub Copilot in VSCode

GitHub Copilot provides in-editor code assistance. To get the most out of it:

1. **Write Detailed Comments**: Before coding, write comprehensive comments describing what you want to implement.

2. **Use TODO Comments**: Specific TODO comments help Copilot understand what you need.

3. **Provide Type Information**: Include type annotations to guide Copilot's suggestions.

4. **Iterate on Suggestions**: If the first suggestion isn't ideal, keep typing or use Alt+] to see alternatives.

**Example Comment Structure for Copilot:**

```javascript
/**
 * Processes Obsidian wikilinks in markdown content
 * 
 * This function should:
 * 1. Find all wikilinks using regex pattern [[...]]
 * 2. Handle aliases with pipe syntax [[Page|Alias]]
 * 3. Convert spaces to hyphens in URLs
 * 4. Properly encode special characters
 * 5. Return the processed content with HTML links
 * 
 * @param {string} content - The markdown content with wikilinks
 * @param {Object} options - Processing options
 * @param {boolean} options.preserveCase - Whether to preserve case in URLs
 * @returns {string} Processed content with HTML links
 */
function processWikilinks(content, options = {}) {
  // Copilot will suggest implementation here
}
```
