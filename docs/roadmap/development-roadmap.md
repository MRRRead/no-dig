# Updated Development Roadmap for NO-DIG

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development plan for NO-DIG, a modular, package-based static site generator that transforms Obsidian vaults into SEO-optimized business websites. The roadmap is organized into phases, with each phase building upon the previous to create a comprehensive, production-ready solution.

## Phase 0: Project Scaffold & Tooling

### Goals (Phase 0)
- Set up monorepo structure with workspaces
- Configure development environment
- Establish coding standards and practices
- Create initial documentation

### Tasks (Phase 0)
1. Initialize repository structure
2. Set up monorepo with workspaces for core, CLI, and adapter packages
3. Configure TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier
4. Set up Jest for testing
5. Configure CI/CD pipeline
6. Implement linting and formatting
7. Set up AI-first development environment

### QA Criteria (Phase 0)
- Repository structure follows monorepo best practices
- All tooling configurations are properly set up
- CI/CD pipeline successfully runs tests and linting
- Documentation provides clear guidance for development

### ðŸ§  AI Prompting Guidance (Phase 0)
When working with AI tools during Phase 0, use this system prompt template:
```
You are a doctorate-level software engineer with specialized expertise in modern web development for content-focused business websites. You're helping me develop NO-DIG, an SEO-first static site generator that transforms Obsidian vaults into business-ready websites.
We're in Phase 0 (Project Scaffold & Tooling), focusing on:
- Setting up the monorepo structure with workspaces
- Configuring the development environment
- Establishing coding standards
- Creating initial documentation
I need your help with [specific task]. Please provide detailed implementation guidance following clean code principles (SOLID, DRY) and ensuring optimal performance.
```

## Phase 1: MVP Content Pipeline

### Goals (Phase 1)
- Implement core content transformation pipeline
- Create basic CLI interface
- Develop 11ty adapter
- Implement wikilink processing
- Establish plugin architecture

### Tasks (Phase 1)
1. Implement Obsidian vault reading
2. Implement wikilink parsing and transformation
3. Implement backlinking functionality
4. Create base layout and templates
5. Implement navigation structure
6. Support page metadata via frontmatter
7. **Implement plugin host system**
8. **Create initial plugin wrappers for essential 11ty plugins**

### QA Criteria (Phase 1)
- Content pipeline successfully transforms Obsidian content
- Wikilinks are properly processed and rendered
- Backlinks are correctly identified and displayed
- Navigation structure is generated from content
- Plugin system allows for extension
- **Plugin wrappers maintain functionality of original plugins**

### Known Issues / Blockers (as of June 2025)
- The 11ty build output does not yet render Obsidian-style wikilinks as HTML links due to unresolved plugin resolution issues with @photogabble/eleventy-plugin-interlinker in a monorepo/Windows environment. All other Phase 1 goals are met. See README and plugin-api.md for details.

### Next Steps
- Resolve 11ty plugin resolution so that wikilinks are rendered as HTML links in the built site.
- Update integration tests to check the actual HTML output from 11ty, not just the core/plugin transform.
- Once this is fixed, Phase 1 will be fully complete and Phase 2 (SEO, images, etc) can begin.
