# NO-DIG Specification

> **SEO-First Business Websites from Obsidian**  
> _Not a Digital Garden._ ðŸš€

## Overview

NO-DIG is an open-source static site generator that transforms structured Obsidian vaults into fast, SEO-optimized, business-ready websites. Unlike "digital garden" tools, NO-DIG is specifically designed for professional business websites with a focus on search engine optimization, performance, and conversion.

## Core Principles

1. **SEO-First Architecture**: Every aspect of NO-DIG is designed with search engine optimization as a primary consideration.
2. **Business-Focused**: Built for commercial websites, not personal knowledge bases or digital gardens.
3. **Performance-Optimized**: Targeting perfect PageSpeed scores and Core Web Vitals metrics.
4. **Clean Code**: Following Uncle Bob's SOLID principles and DRY methodology throughout.
5. **Privacy-Friendly**: GDPR-compliant by default with no vendor lock-in.
6. **Developer Experience**: Intuitive CLI and plugin architecture for efficient workflows.

## Architecture

NO-DIG uses a modular, monorepo architecture with three core packages:

1. **Core Package**: Handles Obsidian vault parsing, content transformation, and SEO optimization.
2. **CLI Package**: Provides command-line interface for project initialization, building, and deployment.
3. **Adapter-11ty Package**: Integrates with 11ty (Eleventy) for static site generation.

This architecture allows for:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Extensibility through additional adapters
- Maintainable, testable code
- Focused functionality in each package

### CLI Workflow

```bash
# Install CLI
npm install -g no-dig

# Initialize project
no-dig init my-business-site

# Build the site
cd my-business-site
npm run build

# Serve locally
npm run preview

# Deploy (with adapter support)
no-dig deploy --adapter=netlify
```

### Configuration

NO-DIG uses a configuration file (`no-dig.config.js`) for project-wide settings:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // Source Obsidian vault
  vault: './content',
  
  // Output directory
  output: './dist',
  
  // Site metadata
  site: {
    title: 'My Business Site',
    description: 'Professional business website',
    url: 'https://example.com',
    lang: 'en',
    locale: 'en_US'
  },
  
  // SEO configuration
  seo: {
    defaultSchemaType: 'WebSite',
    generateSitemap: true,
    generateRobotsTxt: true
  },
  
  // Performance optimization
  performance: {
    images: {
      formats: ['webp', 'avif', 'original'],
      sizes: [640, 1024, 1600]
    },
    fonts: {
      display: 'swap',
      preload: true
    }
  },
  
  // Plugins
  plugins: [
    // Plugin configuration
  ]
}
```

### Frontmatter

NO-DIG uses frontmatter for page-specific configuration:

```yaml
---
title: "Product Page"
description: "Our flagship product details"
schemaType: "Product"
product:
  name: "Premium Widget"
  price: 99.99
  currency: "USD"
  availability: "InStock"
image: "product-hero.jpg"
noIndex: false
canonical: "https://example.com/products/premium-widget"
---
```

## Plugin System

NO-DIG includes a plugin system for extending functionality at every stage of the content pipeline and build process. Plugins can implement lifecycle hooks such as:

- `initialize`
- `beforeBuild`
- `beforeContentProcessing` / `afterContentProcessing`
- `beforeTemplateApplication` / `afterTemplateApplication`
- `beforeAssetProcessing` / `afterAssetProcessing`
- `beforeOutput`
- `afterBuild`
- `onError`

See [plugin-api.md](plugin-api.md) for the full API, context objects, and best practices.

Example plugin registration in `no-dig.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    '@no-dig/plugins/seo',
    ['./my-local-plugin.js', { option: true }]
  ]
};
```

Plugins can be official (`@no-dig/plugins/*`) or third-party (`no-dig-plugin-*`).

## Deployment

NO-DIG supports multiple deployment targets through adapters:

- Netlify
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages
- AWS S3/CloudFront
- Custom FTP/SFTP

## Project Status

Phase 0 (Project Scaffold & Tooling) is complete as of June 2, 2025.

The repository now includes:

- Monorepo structure with core, cli, and adapter-11ty packages
- TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Jest, and GitHub Actions CI configured
- 11ty and Tailwind CSS set up in the adapter-11ty package
- Comprehensive documentation in the docs/ directory

The project is now moving to Phase 1: MVP Content Pipeline.

## Development Roadmap

See the [[roadmap/development-roadmap]] for a detailed implementation plan.

> **Note:** All development tasks, bugs, and feature requests are tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/MRRRead/no-dig/issues). For pre-defined issues by phase, see [[roadmap/github-issues]].

## Refactoring and Clean Code Maintenance

NO-DIG follows a strict Clean Code and refactoring discipline:

- All modules are regularly reviewed for SOLID, DRY, and SRP compliance.
- Plugin interfaces are strictly typed and error handling is robust (errors are logged in all plugin hooks).
- Adapter functions are fully typed and include JSDoc for maintainability.
- Negative and snapshot tests are planned for all output-generating modules.
- This section is updated as part of every major refactor or code review.

## Conclusion

NO-DIG provides a comprehensive solution for transforming Obsidian vaults into professional, SEO-optimized business websites. With its focus on search engine optimization, performance, and business features, NO-DIG fills a gap in the static site generator ecosystem for business-focused websites that leverage the power of Obsidian for content management.
